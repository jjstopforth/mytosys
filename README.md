### Mitosys ###
## The place to find my dotfiles and migration strategies ##

The main branch is for dotfiles and items that remain the same across machines and installations.

This is stuff like `Xresources` or `zshrc`. Other things that are installation specific may be things like `.xsession` stuff or mpd stuff.

## How to use this repository ##

1. Clone this repo somewhere easily accessible (like ~)
2. Where config files are needed simply add "source $mitosis_location/config_file".
3. ???
4. Profit.
